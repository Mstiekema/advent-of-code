# 2025
This year, I am writing the Advent of Code in Rust

## How to create a new entry
1. Go to the `2025/` folder
2. Run `cargo new day_X` for the given day
3. Create an input.txt file with the input for the day
4. Write your code in the `src/main.rs` file

## How to run
1. Enter the folder of the day you want to run
2. Run `cargo run`
3. Check the `output` file and/or the cli to see the result
